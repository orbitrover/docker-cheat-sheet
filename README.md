### What is docker?
   Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Why docker?
   Docker is useful to automate the deployment of applications inside a software containers, which makes the applications easy to ship and run virtually anywhere (i.e, platform independent). The Docker container processes run on the host kernel, unlike VM which runs processes in guest kernel.

### Registries and Repositories
#### Registry:
Docker Registry is a service that stores your docker images. It could be hosted by a third party, as public or private registry. Some of the examples are,

- Docker Hub,
- Quay,
- Google Container Registry,
- AWS Container Registry

#### Repository:
A Docker Repository is a collection of related images with same name which have different tags. These tags are an alphanumeric identifiers(like 1.0 or latest) attached to images within a repository.

For example, if you want to pull golang image using `docker pull golang:latest` command, it will download the image tagged latest within the `golang` repository from the Docker Hub registry. The tags appeared on dockerhub as below,

#### Login
Login to a registry
```js
> docker login [OPTIONS] [SERVER]

[OPTIONS]:
-u/--username username
-p/--password password

Example:

1. docker login localhost:8080 // Login to a registry on your localhost
2. docker login
```

#### Logout
Logout from a registry
```js
> docker logout [SERVER]

Example:

docker logout localhost:8080 // Logout from a registry on your localhost
```

#### Search image
Search for an image in registry
```js
docker search [OPTIONS] TERM

Example:
docker search golang
docker search --filter stars=3 --no-trunc golang
```
#### Pull image

This command pulls an image or a repository from a registry to local machine

```js
docker image pull [OPTIONS] NAME[:TAG|@DIGEST]

Example:
docker image pull golang:latest
```
#### Push image

This command pushes an image to the registry from local machine.

```js
docker image push [OPTIONS] NAME[:TAG]
docker image push golang:latest
```

### Networks
   Docker provides network commands connect containers to each other and to other non-Docker workloads. The usage of network commands would be `docker network COMMAND`

#### List networks
List down available networks

```cmd
docker network ls
```

#### Connect a container to network
You can connect a container by name or by ID to any network. Once it connected, the container can communicate with other containers in the same network.

```cmd
docker network connect [OPTIONS] NETWORK CONTAINER

Example:
docker network connect multi-host-network container1
```

#### Disconnect a container from a network
You can disconnect a container by name or by ID from any network.

```cmd
docker network disconnect [OPTIONS] NETWORK CONTAINER

Example:
docker network disconnect multi-host-network container1
```

#### Remove one or more networks
Removes one or more networks by name or identifier. Remember, you must first disconnect any containers connected to it before removing it.

```cmd
docker network rm NETWORK [NETWORK...]

Example:
docker network rm my-network
```

#### Create network
It is possible to create a network in Docker before launching containers

```cmd
docker network create [OPTIONS] NETWORK

Example:
sudo docker network create –-driver bridge some_network
```

The above command will output the long ID for the new network.

#### Inspect network
You can see more details on the network associated with Docker using network inspect command.

```cmd
docker network inspect networkname

Example:
docker network inspect bridge
```
### Cleanup commands

You may need to cleanup resources (containers, volumes, images, networks) regularly.

#### Remove all unused resources

```cmd
docker system prune
```

#### Images

```cmd
$ docker images
$ docker rmi $(docker images --filter "dangling=true" -q --no-trunc)

$ docker images | grep "none"
$ docker rmi $(docker images | grep "none" | awk '/ / { print $3 }')
```

#### Containers

```cmd
$ docker ps
$ docker ps -a
$ docker rm $(docker ps -qa --no-trunc --filter "status=exited")
```

#### Volumes

```cmd
$ docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -qf dangling=true)
$ docker volume ls -qf dangling=true | xargs -r docker volume rm
```

#### Networks

```cmd
$ docker network ls
$ docker network ls | grep "bridge"
$ docker network rm $(docker network ls | grep "bridge" | awk '/ / { print $1 }')
```

### Utility commands

  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Docker Hub
   Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository provided by Docker to test, store and distribute container images which can be accessed either privately or publicly.

#### From
   It initializes a new image and sets the Base Image for subsequent instructions. It must be a first non-comment instruction in the Dockerfile.
   ```cmd
   FROM <image>
   FROM <image>:<tag>
   FROM <image>@<digest>
   ```
   **Note:** Both `tag` and `digest` are optional. If you omit either of them, the builder assumes a latest by default.

### Dockerfile
   Dockerfile is a text document that contains set of commands and instructions which will be executed in a sequence in the docker environment for building a new docker image.

#### FROM
This command Sets the Base Image for subsequent instructions

```cmd
FROM <image>
FROM <image>:<tag>
FROM <image>@<digest>

Example:
FROM ubuntu:18.04
```

#### RUN

RUN instruction allows you to install your application and packages required for it. It executes any commands on top of the current image and creates a new layer by committing the results. It is quite common to have multiple RUN instructions in a Dockerfile.

It has two forms
1. Shell Form: RUN <command>
```cmd
RUN npm start
```
2. Exec form RUN ["<executable>", "<param1>", "<param2>"]
```cmd
RUN [ "npm", "start" ]
```

#### ENTRYPOINT
An ENTRYPOINT allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable. It is used to run when container starts.

```cmd
Exec Form:
ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]
Shell Form:
ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2

Example:
FROM alpine:3.5
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/echo", "Print ENTRYPOINT instruction of Exec Form"]

```

If an image has an ENTRYPOINT and pass an argument to it while running the container, it wont override the existing entrypoint but it just appends what you passed with the entrypoint. To override the existing ENTRYPOINT. you should user `–entrypoint` flag for the running container.

Let's see the behavior with the above dockerfile,

```cmd
Build image:
docker build -t entrypointImage .

Run the image:
docker container run entrypointImage // Print ENTRYPOINT instruction of Exec Form

Override entrypoint:
docker run --entrypoint "/bin/echo" entrypointImage "Override ENTRYPOINT instruction" // Override ENTRYPOINT instruction
```

#### CMD
CMD instruction is used to set a default command, which will be executed only when you run a container without specifying a command. But if the docker container runs with a command, the default command will be ignored.

The CMD instruction has three forms,
```cmd
1. Exec form:
CMD ["executable","param1","param2"]
2. Default params to ENTRYPOINT:
CMD ["param1","param2"]
3. Shell form:
CMD command param1 param2
```

The main purpose of the CMD command is to launch the required software in a container. For example, running an executable .exe file or a Bash terminal as soon as the container starts.

Remember, if docker runs with executable and parameters then CMD instruction will be overridden(Unlike ENTRYPOINT).

```cmd
docker run executable parameters
```

**Note:** There should only be one CMD command in your Dockerfile. Otherwise only the last instance of CMD will be executed.

#### COPY
The COPY instruction copies new files or directories from source and adds them to the destination filesystem of the container.

```cmd
COPY [--chown=<user>:<group>] <src>... <dest>
COPY [--chown=<user>:<group>] ["<src>",... "<dest>"]

Example:
COPY test.txt /absoluteDir/
COPY tes? /absoluteDir/ // Copies all files or directories starting with test to destination container
```

The <src> path must be relative to the source directory that is being built. Whereas <dest> is an absolute path, or a path relative to `WORKDIR`.
#### ADD
The ADD instruction copies new files, directories or remote file URLs from source and adds them to the filesystem of the image at the destination path. The functionality is similar to COPY command and supports two forms of usage,

```cmd
ADD [--chown=<user>:<group>] <src>... <dest>
ADD [--chown=<user>:<group>] ["<src>",... "<dest>"]

Example:
ADD test.txt /absoluteDir/
ADD tes? /absoluteDir/ // Copies all files or directories starting with test to destination container
```

ADD commands provides additional features such as downloading remote resources, extracting TAR files etc.

```cmd
1. Download an external file and copy to the destination
ADD http://source.file/url  /destination/path

2. Copies compressed files and extract the content in the destination
ADD source.file.tar.gz /temp
```

#### ENV
The ENV instruction sets the environment variable <key> to the value <value>. It has two forms,

1. The first form, `ENV <key> <value>`, will set a single variable to a value.
2. The second form, `ENV <key>=<value> ...`, allows for multiple variables to be set at one time.

```cmd
ENV <key> <value>
ENV <key>=<value> [<key>=<value> ...]

Example:
ENV name="John Doe" age=40
ENV name John Doe
ENV age 40
```

#### EXPOSE
The EXPOSE instruction informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. i.e, It helps in inter-container communication. You can specify whether the port listens on TCP or UDP, and the default is TCP.

```cmd
EXPOSE <port> [<port>/<protocol>...]

Example:
EXPOSE 80/udp
EXPOSE 80/tcp
```

But if you want to bind the port of the container with the host machine on which the container is running, use -p option of `docker run` command.

```cmd
docker run -p <HOST_PORT>:<CONTAINER:PORT> IMAGE_NAME

Example:
docker run -p 80:80/udp myDocker
```

#### WORKDIR
The WORKDIR command is used to define the working directory of a Docker container at any given time for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY and ADD instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile.

```cmd
WORKDIR /path/to/workdir

Example:
WORKDIR /c
WORKDIR d
WORKDIR e
RUN pwd  // /c/d/e
```

#### LABEL
The LABEL instruction adds metadata as key-value pairs to an image. Labels included in base or parent images (images in the FROM line) are inherited by your image.

```cmd
LABEL <key>=<value> <key>=<value> <key>=<value> ...

Example:
LABEL version="1.0"
LABEL multi.label1="value1" \
      multi.label2="value2" \
      other="value3"
```

You can view an image’s labels using the `docker image inspect --format='' myimage` command. The output would be as below,

```js
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "multi.label1": "value1",
  "multi.label2": "value2",
  "other": "value3"
}
```

#### MAINTAINER
The MAINTAINER instruction sets the Author field of the generated images.
```cmd
MAINTAINER <name>

Example:
MAINTAINER John
```

This command is deprecated status now and the recommended usage is with LABEL command
```cmd
LABEL maintainer="John"
```

#### VOLUME
The VOLUME instruction creates a mount point with the specified name and mounted volumes from native host or other containers.

```cmd
VOLUME ["/data"]

Example:
FROM ubuntu
RUN mkdir /test
VOLUME /test
```

### Docker Compose
   Docker compose(or compose) is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
### Docker Swarm
   Docker Swarm(or swarm) is an open-source tool used to cluster and orchestrate Docker containers.
